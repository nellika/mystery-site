            It is time to get game out of computer!
            You have an unique opportunity to participate in our race and explore Poland.
            Alone or in pairs you will hitchhike between Polish cities.
            On your way you have total freedom of choice. In our app you can find attractions for visiting which you can gain some extra points.

            When you reach one of the destinations, we have prepared contests to get higher position in game ranking.
            On every stage of the competition you can change your partner or decide to go further alone. Remember, it is always up to you :)
