			<h1> Description of Poland </h1>
			<p> Poland is a beautiful land situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south.
			During this journey you are going to visit several districts of Poland: Pomerania, Warmia-Masuria, Masovia, Holy Cross Province, Lesser Poland, Silesia, Opole, Lower Silesia, Greater Poland, West Pomerania. Each of them has different traditions and natural heritage, which you can discover.
			This country is not only full of beautiful landscapes, lakes and mountains, but it also has a rich history.
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="monkey">
			<p> In the golden age its borders reached from the Baltic to the Black Sea, but after partition of Poland it has completely despaired from the world map.
			People here are kind and hospitable. Polish hospitality originates not in the present time, but from the period of Sarmatia and noble mansions. Hosts will probably welcome you with traditional polish dishes and you never going to be hungry, because they believe that the guest always needs to get some warm meal. Most of them speaks English, which is very helpful during hitchhiking. </p></div>
